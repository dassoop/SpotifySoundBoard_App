**How to use**

1. Sign in to spotify from their web page on the device you want to control with.
2. Open spotify on the device you want the audio to play from (the controller/playback device can be the same device or 2 seperate devices).
3. If you do not connect, keep the Spotify app open on playback device and then close and re-open the EZSoundBoard app.
4. Due to hardware restrictions, the playback device must be a computer to use the fade in feature. This will not work if the Spotify app is run from mobile device.
